# ‚úÖ **Project Title: Green Hydrogen Cost Estimator Tool**

---

## üìå Executive Summary

The Green Hydrogen Cost Estimator Tool is a strategic solution designed to support India's energy transition by providing **real-time, location-specific cost estimates** for producing and transporting green hydrogen. This tool helps industrial stakeholders, particularly **BHEL**, assess project feasibility, reduce uncertainty in green hydrogen adoption, and improve investment planning. It bridges the gap between **equipment manufacturing** and **decision-making analytics**, positioning BHEL not only as a hydrogen equipment provider but also as a **technology advisor** in the green hydrogen value chain.

---

## üß© Problem Statement

Despite India‚Äôs push toward green hydrogen adoption under the **National Green Hydrogen Mission**, industrial deployment remains limited due to:

1. **Uncertainty in Cost Projections**:
   Project stakeholders lack access to tools that calculate the **Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH)** based on energy source, geography, and technology.

2. **Fragmented Economic Visibility**:
   No standardized platform exists to evaluate CAPEX, OPEX, transport, storage, and subsidies holistically.

3. **Low Adoption Confidence Among Industrial Clients**:
   Refineries, steel plants, and fertilizer companies hesitate to switch from grey hydrogen due to perceived cost risks.

4. **Missed Opportunities for Equipment Providers like BHEL**:
   Without such a tool, BHEL risks being viewed only as a hardware vendor, not a strategic partner offering comprehensive hydrogen solutions.

## üéØ Project Objective

To design and develop a **Green Hydrogen Cost Estimator Tool** that:

* Estimates LCOH (‚Çπ/kg or \$/kg) across different production technologies.
* Models hydrogen transportation and storage costs.
* Performs **sensitivity analysis** on electricity prices, load factors, and electrolyzer types.
* Supports **industrial-scale project planning** for clients in oil refining, steel, fertilizer, and energy sectors.
* Enables **BHEL to offer consultative services** and gain a competitive edge in green hydrogen markets.

---

## üß† Strategic Thinking Behind the Project

This tool aligns with:

* **BHEL‚Äôs strategic pivot** from a pure equipment manufacturer to a **hydrogen technology provider**.
* India‚Äôs goal of producing **5 MMT of green hydrogen annually by 2030**.
* Emerging needs of hydrogen-consuming sectors like **IOCL, JSW Steel, and NFL**, which require reliable cost estimates before investing.
* The **hydrogen economy value chain**, where accurate modeling tools influence upstream (electrolyzer choice), midstream (storage/logistics), and downstream (industrial use).
